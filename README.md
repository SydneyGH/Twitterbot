# Twitterbot

This is a bot that can like, retweet, follow and unfollow users. If a hashtag or user is searched the bot will like and retweet a given number of posts, all occurring in a certain amount of time. This bot will also prompt the user that someone has unfollowed them and ask if you would like to do the same. The user then chooses yes or no, if yes then the bot will give a message stating the user has been unfollowed along with the user’s screen name and continue to unfollow that user, if the user chooses no, the bot will do nothing. The user may also have a lot of other users they do not follow, the bot can run through their following list and follow each user printing their screen name as it goes through the list. The user may also have an individual person they may want to follow and unfollow, it’s as simple as typing the @name in the follow/unfollow() when you are ready to run the code.  The bot can also reply, like, and retweet to users post once an @name or #hashtag is used. Once replying, the bot can be given something to say, for example “HELLO TWITTER WORLD”. 

The modules used are ‘Tweepy’ and ‘time’. The Tweepy module is used to pull information from the Twitter API.  The information is then converted in to JSON which is then used in order for the bot to take action. The time module is also used for a wait time after each action is performed by the bot.
